		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello world! I'm a second year computer engineering 
		student at the University if Victoria with a passion 
		for aerospace and cool technology. For 6 years I was 
		involved in competitive robotics, competing internationally 
		with my team mates, and  helping to grow the FIRST community
		in BC. Now I'm the Avionics Lead for UVic Rocketry, working 
		to develop the electronics that will get our rocket to 
		30,000 feet! Some of my passtimes include: cooking foods 
		from around the world, language learning, and exploring all 
		hidden crevaces of my favourite tech.</p>
